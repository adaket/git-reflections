When would you want to creat a remote repository rather then keeping all your work local?
  when working with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	just like the commit, auto is not always we may want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork just on GitHub, with links back to original
	clone is from remote to local
	branches is several commit lines

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	compare and merge
